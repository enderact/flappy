Flappy Bird

Tools used :
Visual Studio 2022
SFML (C++)

Overview:
Normal Mode: normal mode with pipes
Hard Mode: mode with phirana plants coming out of pipes

Instructions: Use mouse to selete options and make the bird jump (LEFT CLICK)

Bugs:
Bird sometimes jump randomly(rarely)

Bird dies after passing the first tunnel(HARD MODE) (Related to the Phirana Plants) (rarely)

Bird can lag at start as I have not added any lag timer but it will become smooth in some time
This lag can be noticed by less jump height of the bird;


Edit - Change the Visual studio settings for SFML, I have used my own paths for the libraries
